# Socket-programming in Python
Sockets and the socket API are used to send messages across a network.
They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC). 
The network can be a logical, local network to the computer, 
or one thatâ€™s physically connected to an external network, 
with its own connections to other networks. 
The obvious example is the Internet, which you connect to via your ISP.
